## Installation

git clone https://github.com/Stewpra/README-generator.git

## Usage

The app is used by first calling the index.js in node.js with the command “node index.js”. The user is then prompted to answer a few short questions and the application will handle the rest. The user’s answers are stored in a variable that is then passed through to a function that creates the readme and passes in all the information.
